# Schema for xDemic
xDemic will use a [Verifiable Credentials Data Model] (https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), combinded with [IMS Extended Credentials Schema]  

The following is included in the claims section of the JWT that is sent using uport.

## Example

The above is the Schema for a Single Claim Course Record Claim.

### Exaplanation

* @context describes the schema used to generate this single claim. In this case the both the verifiable credentials and the Extended Transcripts schema are used.
* "id": "urn:uuid:bbba8553-8ec1-445f-82c9-a57251dd731c", provides a unique identifier for this specific credential
* "type", defines the type of credential contained.
* "issuer", DID of the school
* "claims", this contains the content of the claim.
	* "id", this id refers to the subject of the credential, in this case the student, this key is inherited from the Verifiable Credentials type
	* "records", is a list of transcript records issued to the student. 
		* "id", is the unique identifier for this particular record
		* "type" describes it as a record
		* "date": "2016-12-01T00:00:0000Z",
		* "term": "Fall 2016",
		* "result": "A-",
		* "credits": 4,
		* "recordOf" is an object that describes what this is a record off, i.e the course
		* "id", is the urn for the course this is a record off 
		* "type", the type in this case is a "TranscriptEntityLink", i.e. it tells us that the course is part of a transcript
		* "entityType": "Course", tells us that the entity is a course
		* "entityId": "urn:uuid:0147F2A5-799A-47E6-832F-B114A7674AA7"
	* "transcriptEntities", defines the entities that make up this academic path
		* courses and degree are both the things that make up this transcript.
* proof is a required component of this verifiable credential, making this credential tamper proof. The JWS is generated by the issuers DID
