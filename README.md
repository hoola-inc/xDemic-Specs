## Protocols and Tech

## [*IPLD as a general pattern for DID documents and Verifiable Claims*](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/ipld-did.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/final-documents/ipld-did.md)

> Since the emergence of the Decentralized Identifier (DID) specification at the Fall 2016 Rebooting the Web of Trust [1], numerous DID method specifications have appeared. Each DID method specification defines how to resolve a cryptographically-tied DID document given a method-specific identifier. In this paper, we describe a way to represent the DID document as a content-addressed Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using Interplanetary Linked Data (IPLD). This technique enables more cost-efficient, scaleable creation of DIDs and can be applied across different DID method specifications.

## [*Peer to Peer Degrees of Trust*](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/peer-to-peer-degrees-of-trust.pdf) [(Text)](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/final-documents/peer-to-peer-degrees-of-trust.md)

> Aunthenticity is a challenge for any identity solution. In the physical world, at least in America, it is not difficult to change one's identity. In the digital world, there is the problem of bots. The botnet detection market is expected to be worth over one billion USD by 2023, in a landscape where most digital activity is still heavily centralized. These centralized digital solutions have the advantage of being able to track IP addresses, request phone verification, and present CAPTCHAs to users in order to authenticate them. If this problem is so difficult to solve in the centralized world, how much more challenging will it be in the decentralized world, where none of these techniques are available?

> As systems where people are required to manage their own cryptographic keys become more popular, social recovery or reissuance of keys increases in importance. Such systems are inherently empowering to users but safeguarding keys is a hard problem.

> We focus on the social recovery of control of an identifier. There are several techniques to re-assert control over identifiers including key recovery and issuance of a new key. In many situations it is preferrable to establish a new key than recover the old one.

> We propose a rubrik for evaluating such schemes, and give a brief overview of possible schemes to consider.

> In this paper, we explore the idea of using a web of trust as a tool to add authenticity to decentralized identifiers (DIDs). We define a framework for deriving relative trust degrees using a given trust metric: a "trustworthiness" score for a given identity from the perspective of another identity. It is our intent that this framework may be used as a starting point for an ongoing exploration of graph-based, decentralized trust. We believe this approach may ultimately be used as a foundation for decentralized reputation.
